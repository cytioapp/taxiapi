### üè† [What is Cytio??](https://www.cytio.com.mx/)

## Install

Before starting to install dependencies, have to be sure that you already have
`Postgress 9.x` or higher, has to be up an running, also you'll need to create an
empty database called `taxidb`.

Another thing is you'll need `node` and `npm` installed in your computer, so, at the
moment I'm writing this README I have installed `node 10.16.3` and `npm 6.9.0` and
everything works perfect.

So it's time to install dependencies, you can run the commands below

```sh
npm install -g knex
npm install -g nodemon
npm install
```

You'll need to run this commands for migrations and seeds

```sh
knex migrate:latest
knex seed:run
```
## Usage

IMPORTANT: To run the project properly, has to ask for some environment files as the `.env` and `firebaseconfig.json`, and put it in root project,
whitout whis important files, the project just won't run.

If you're ready, run

```sh
nodemon
```
That's it !!!
